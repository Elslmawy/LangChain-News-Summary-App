# LangChain News Summary App  

This application fetches news articles based on user input, processes them, and generates a summary using LangChain and Groq's Llama3 model.

## Features

Fetches news articles from NewsAPI.

Uses a sentence transformer model for text processing.

Summarizes fetched articles using a Groq-powered language model.

Saves user preferences for future queries.

## How It Works  

The user enters a topic of interest.

The application fetches relevant news articles from NewsAPI.

The retrieved articles are processed, extracting titles and descriptions.

The extracted text is passed to Groq's Llama3 model for summarization.

The generated summary is displayed to the user.

User preferences, including the last searched query, are saved for future use.
